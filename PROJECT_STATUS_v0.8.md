## üèÜ **v0.8 Major Achievement: Dynamic Plot Management**

### **Problem Solved**
The application had a fixed dual-channel interface that didn't allow for flexible plot configuration, custom channel selection, or advanced visualization options.

### **Solution Implemented**
- **Dynamic plot grid system**: Automatically resizes from 1x1 to 3x3 based on number of plots
- **Add Plot dialog**: Configure new plots with channel selection, Y-axis range, color, and title

- **Mirror windows**: Double-click any plot to open an independent copy in a separate window
- **Plot management**: Edit, delete, and reorder plots with dedicated controls
- **Single plot per channel**: Prevents conflicts by allowing only one Channel A and one Channel B plot
- **Control state management**: Proper enabling/disabling of controls during logging sessions

### **Impact**
