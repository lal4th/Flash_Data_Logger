# New Chat Prompt for Multi-Device Compatibility Work

## Context
You are continuing work on the Flash Data Logger multi-device compatibility project. The goal is to support both PicoScope 4262 (ps4000/ps4000a API) and 6824E (ps6000a API) devices with full multi-channel data acquisition and plotting.

## Current Status
**SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE** - Most issues have been resolved through systematic debugging. One critical issue remains, but currently blocked by computer connection problem.

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- Device detection and connection for both 4262 and 6824E
- Timeline display shows relative seconds (0, 1, 2, 3...) instead of Unix timestamps
- Plot positioning: traces start at time=0 instead of being compressed to the right
- Multi-channel architecture: supports 8 channels (A-H) for 6824E, 2 channels (A-B) for 4262
- Channel configuration: all channels properly configured
- Data acquisition: `_acquire_block()` returns 9 elements (timestamp + 8 channels)
- Data processing: `_process_block()` returns 10 elements (timestamp + 8 channels + math_results)
- Plot queue: `_queue_plot_data()` creates 9-element payloads with all 8 channels

### ❌ **Remaining Issue:**
**Multi-Channel Data Display**: Only channels A and B show data; channels C-H show nothing despite being configured. The issue is in the `_update_plot()` method's signal emission logic.

### ⚠️ **Current Blocker:**
**Computer Connection Issue**: The 6824E cannot connect to this computer with either Flash Data Logger or PicoScope 7 software. It works on another computer. User is restarting to resolve this hardware/software connection problem.

**Root Cause**: The condition in `_update_plot()` is overly restrictive:
```python
if all_channel_c_values and hasattr(self, '_accumulated_plot_data_c') and len(self._accumulated_plot_data_c) > 0:
```

**Problem**: This fails because `_accumulated_plot_data_c` doesn't exist on first run, and the length check is unnecessary.

**Attempted Fix**: Simplified to `if all_channel_c_values:` but this broke 6824E detection, so it was reverted.

## Your Task
1. **First Priority**: Wait for user to restart computer and verify 6824E connection is restored
2. **Second Priority**: Fix the signal emission logic in the `_update_plot()` method to properly emit extended multi-channel data to the UI without breaking device detection

## Key Files
- `app/core/streaming_controller.py` - Contains the problematic `_update_plot()` method (around line 1177)
- `app/ui/main_window.py` - Handles the emitted plot data
- `MULTI_DEVICE_ATTEMPT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete documentation of all work done

## Critical Requirements
1. **DO NOT declare victory before user testing** - wait for user confirmation
2. **Use systematic approach** - create debug scripts to test changes
3. **Make incremental changes** - small, testable modifications
4. **Preserve working functionality** - don't break 6824E detection

## Expected Result
After the fix:
- Channels A and B: Should show sine waves (already working)
- Channels C and D: Should show different sine wave patterns with different frequencies
- No error messages in GUI status
- 6824E detection should continue working

## Testing Approach
1. **After Computer Restart**: Verify 6824E detection and connection works
2. **Then**: Create a debug script to test the `_update_plot()` method in isolation
3. **Then**: Make the minimal fix to the condition
4. **Then**: Test in GUI with channels A, B, C, D added
5. **Finally**: Verify all channels show data and no errors occur

## User Feedback Context
The user was frustrated with premature victory declarations and breaking working functionality. They specifically requested:
- No claims of fixes before testing
- Systematic, step-by-step approach
- Preservation of working state
- Comprehensive documentation

## Branch Information
- Working on `multi-device-compatibility` branch
- All progress documented in `MULTI_DEVICE_ATTEMPT_SUMMARY.md`
- Extensive debug scripts created in `scripts/` directory

## Next Steps
1. **Wait for user to restart computer and verify 6824E connection**
2. **Then**: Read the current `_update_plot()` method in `streaming_controller.py`
3. **Then**: Create a debug script to test the signal emission logic
4. **Then**: Make the minimal fix to resolve the overly restrictive condition
5. **Finally**: Test in GUI and wait for user confirmation before claiming success

Remember: The user has been very clear about not declaring victory before testing. Always wait for their confirmation that something is working before moving on. Also, the computer connection issue must be resolved first before any code fixes can be tested.
