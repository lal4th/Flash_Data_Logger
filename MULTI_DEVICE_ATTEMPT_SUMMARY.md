# Multi-Device Compatibility Attempt Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the attempt to add multi-device compatibility to the Flash Data Logger, specifically to support the PicoScope 6824E in addition to the existing 4262 support.

## Current Status: **PARTIALLY WORKING WITH CRITICAL ISSUES**

### What Works:
- ✅ **Device Detection**: Successfully detects and connects to 6824E
- ✅ **Channel Configuration**: Properly configures channels A-H on 6824E
- ✅ **Dynamic Channel List**: "Add Plot" dialog shows all available channels (A-H) instead of just A-B
- ✅ **Multi-Device Architecture**: Controller and streaming controller handle both 4262 and 6824E
- ✅ **Connection Management**: Proper device handle management and cleanup

### Critical Issues Remaining:
- ❌ **Plot Timeline**: X-axis shows Unix timestamps (1.75815e+09) instead of relative seconds (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- ❌ **Plot Positioning**: Sine wave traces appear on the far right side of plots instead of starting from the y-axis
- ❌ **Data Generation**: Still using placeholder test data instead of actual PicoScope readings
- ❌ **Timeline Conversion**: Relative timestamp conversion from session start is not working properly

## Files Modified/Created:

### New Files:
- `app/acquisition/pico_6000_direct.py` - Direct 6824E acquisition source
- `scripts/test_picosdk_connection.py` - Standalone connection test
- `scripts/test_6824e_gui.py` - Standalone 6824E test GUI
- `scripts/simple_4262_test.py` - Simple 4262 test
- `scripts/simple_6824e_test.py` - Simple 6824E test

### Modified Files:
- `app/acquisition/pico.py` - Extended detection to support ps6000a API
- `app/core/controller.py` - Added multi-device support and channel detection
- `app/core/streaming_controller.py` - Added 6824E support and relative timestamps
- `app/ui/main_window.py` - Dynamic channel population and plot fixes

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Device Detection:
- Extended `detect_picoscope()` to iterate through ("ps4000", "ps4000a", "ps6000a")
- Added proper ps6000a API handling with correct buffer arguments
- Implemented device info retrieval for 6824E

### Multi-Device Architecture:
- Added `_pico_6000_source` to both `AppController` and `StreamingController`
- Implemented device-specific configuration paths
- Added `get_available_channels()` method for dynamic UI updates

### Channel Management:
- 6824E supports channels A-H (8 channels)
- 4262 supports channels A-B (2 channels)
- Dynamic channel list population in plot configuration dialog

### Data Acquisition:
- Created `Pico6000DirectSource` class inheriting from `AcquisitionSource`
- Implemented `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `configure_channel()` methods
- Added `read_dual_channel()` method (currently returns test data)

## Known Issues and Debugging Attempts:

### Issue 1: Timeline Problems
**Problem**: X-axis shows Unix timestamps instead of relative seconds
**Attempted Fixes**:
- Added `_session_start_time` to `StreamingController.start()`
- Modified `_process_block()` to convert absolute timestamps to relative seconds
- **Result**: Still showing Unix timestamps in plots

### Issue 2: Plot Positioning
**Problem**: Traces appear on far right instead of starting from y-axis
**Attempted Fixes**:
- Modified `PlotPanel.update_data()` to manage X-axis range properly
- Added dynamic buffer sizing based on timeline and sample rate
- **Result**: Traces still appear compressed on the right side

### Issue 3: Data Generation
**Problem**: Still using placeholder zeros instead of test signals
**Attempted Fixes**:
- Implemented `read_dual_channel()` with sine/cosine wave generation
- Added noise and realistic signal patterns
- **Result**: Debug output still shows `A=0.0, B=0.0` (old code being used)

### Issue 4: Application Restart Problems
**Problem**: Changes not being loaded after application restart
**Attempted Fixes**:
- Killed Python processes and cleared cache
- Multiple application restarts
- **Result**: Application still runs old cached version

## Current Debug Output:
```
DEBUG: read_dual_channel() returned: A=0.0, B=0.0, t=1758147645.8853586
```
This indicates the old placeholder code is still being executed despite the new implementation.

## Next Steps Required:
1. **Fix Timeline Conversion**: Ensure relative timestamps are properly calculated and displayed
2. **Fix Plot X-Axis Range**: Make traces start from y-axis and scroll properly
3. **Fix Data Generation**: Ensure new test signal code is actually being executed
4. **Implement Real Data Acquisition**: Replace test signals with actual PicoScope readings
5. **Debug Application Loading**: Resolve why code changes aren't being loaded

## Branch Information:
- **Branch Name**: `multi-device-compatibility`
- **Base**: Main development branch
- **Status**: Incomplete - requires significant additional work
- **Testing**: Only 6824E tested (4262 not available for testing)

## User Feedback:
- "Very frustrating working with you today, really did a crappy job."
- "Same problem. Please document everything you have done and save this mess as a branch on the git."
- "Be sure to document the fact that this code still only shows sin waveforms in the wrong place on the plots with an incorrect timeline."

## Conclusion:
While significant progress was made in device detection and multi-device architecture, the core plotting and data acquisition issues remain unresolved. The implementation is partially functional but requires substantial additional work to meet the user's requirements.
